								<h2>About Me</h2>
								<p>
									My educational journey has been characterized by a strong commitment to data analytics and a
									drive to excel in the field. I hold a Master of Science in Business Insights and Analytics from Humber
									College, Toronto, and a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Mumbai University. These
									academic achievements have provided me with a solid foundation in both the technical and analytical
									aspects of data analysis.
									My professional journey began with an enriching experience as a Data Analyst at Kan Innovations in Mumbai, India,
									from July 2019 to December 2021. In this role, I assumed a leadership position, overseeing and mentoring
									a team of data analytics and data engineering professionals. This experience allowed me to foster
									continuous learning and collaboration, reinforcing the importance of teamwork within a data-centric
									environment.
									My responsibilities at Kan Innovations encompassed the development of advanced SQL queries in
									Postgres and relational databases. These queries were instrumental in uncovering valuable insights from
									complex datasets, ultimately aiding in strategic planning and the refinement of business models. Utilizing
									Power BI, I conducted in-depth analysis of patient foot health data, identifying trends and insights crucial
									for informed insole design improvements and enhanced patient care strategies.
									My journey in the field of data analysis continued as a Data Analyst Intern at Interact Health
									Pro in Toronto, Ontario, from April 2023 to August 2023. During this internship, I played a pivotal role in
									transforming data analysis and reporting within the organization. I successfully implemented Tableau
									solutions, leading to improved decision-making processes and the streamlining of operations.
									Collaborating closely with internal teams, I gained a deep understanding of the organization's evolving
									business needs and strategies.
									One of my key contributions during this internship was the implementation of robust data governance
									practices within Power BI. This initiative ensured data accuracy, consistency, and reliability in healthcare
									reporting, a critical aspect of the organization's operations. I also excelled in generating reports and
									harnessing data to develop analytics focused on key performance and operational metrics.
